Hi [Name],

Love what you're doing with [Project]! 

I built ReleasePilot specifically for open source projects like yours - 
it's free forever for public repos.

It automatically:
- Generates release notes from PRs
- Updates CHANGELOG.md
- Handles semantic versioning
- Notifies your team

Want me to set it up for you? Takes 2 minutes.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### For Companies

Hi [Name],

[Competitor] recently started using ReleasePilot and told me
