Title: I built a GitHub Action that automates releases with AI-powered changelogs

Hey r/github! 

After manually writing release notes for the 100th time, I built ReleasePilot - a GitHub Action that:

✅ Generates PR summaries using AI
✅ Auto-bumps semantic versions based on commits
✅ Updates CHANGELOG.md with proper formatting
✅ Creates GitHub releases automatically
✅ Sends Slack/Teams notifications

It's free for public repos and takes 2 minutes to set up.

Would love your feedback!
```

**r/devops Post:**
```
Title: Automated my entire release process - 10 hours/month saved

Our team was spending way too much time on releases. Built this GitHub Action that handles everything:

- Semantic versioning (feat = minor, fix = patch)
- Changelog generation with compare links
- AI summaries for non-technical stakeholders
- Notifications to Slack/Teams

Setup:
\```yaml
- uses: your-org/release-pilot@v1
\```

Open sourced it - free for public repos!
```

### Reddit Strategy
1. Post between 9-10 AM EST (peak traffic)
2. Engage genuinely with comments
3. Don't post same content to multiple subs same day
4. Follow 9:1 rule (9 helpful comments per 1 promotion)
