### Reddit Post (r/azuredevops, r/AZURE)

**Title:** Just launched: First AI-powered release automation for Azure DevOps - looking for beta testers!

Hey Azure DevOps community!

After seeing how much time our GitHub Action saves developers (10+ hours/month), we've built the same thing for Azure Pipelines.

**What it does:**
- AI (GPT-4) analyzes your commits and work items to generate release notes
- Automatic semantic versioning based on changes
- Native deployment to Azure services (App Service, Functions, AKS)
- Blue-green and canary deployment strategies
- Links work items in changelogs automatically

**Why it's different:**
This is the FIRST AI-powered release tool specifically for Azure DevOps. The AI actually understands your code changes and writes release notes that make sense to your stakeholders.

**Example changelog it generates:**
```
## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-26

### Added
- OAuth2 authentication for enterprise SSO (Work Item #1234)
- Real-time dashboard with performance metrics (Work Item #1235)

### Fixed
- Memory leak in background workers affecting 10% of users
- Mobile responsive issues on iOS devices

### Azure Deployments
- Deployed to East US App Service with 0% downtime
- Canary release to 10% of AKS pods
```

**Setup is literally 2 minutes:**
```yaml
- task: ReleasePilot@1
  inputs:
    openaiApiKey: $(OPENAI_API_KEY)
    action: 'full-release'
```

**Looking for beta testers!** 
- Free lifetime license for first 10 beta testers who provide feedback
- 40% off for everyone else with code: AZURE40

Check it out: https://releasepilot.net/azure-devops

Would love your feedback on what features would make this more useful for your Azure DevOps workflows!

The problem with Azure DevOps releases:

The AI is the game-changer.

Instead of:
"Fixed bug in user service (Work Item #1234)"

You get:
"Resolved authentication timeout affecting enterprise SSO users during peak hours. This fix improves login success rate by 15%."

It understands context!

**Tweet 5:**
Native Azure integration:
- Deploy to App Service
- Update Azure Functions
- Roll out to AKS clusters
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Instant rollbacks

All automated based on your pipeline success.

**Tweet 6:**
Real example from a customer:

Before: 3 hours per release
After: 5 minutes

Time saved per month: 12 hours
Cost saved per month: $1,800
Deployment errors: -95%

ROI in first week.

## üìù FAQ Responses

**Q: "How is this different from Azure DevOps built-in features?"**
A: Azure DevOps doesn't have AI-powered release notes or automatic semantic versioning. We add intelligence to your existing pipelines.

**Q: "Is my code safe?"**
A: We only read commit messages and work items. No source code access needed. SOC2 compliant.

**Q: "What if the AI makes mistakes?"**
A: You can review/edit before publishing. The AI learns from your corrections.

**Q: "Do I need an OpenAI API key?"**
A: Yes, or we can provide one for enterprise accounts.
