**Title:** I built an AI-powered GitHub Action that writes your release notes and handles deployments - looking for feedback!

**Post:**

Hey r/devops!

After spending way too many hours writing changelogs and managing releases, I built a GitHub Action that automates the entire process using AI.

**What it does:**
- Uses GPT-4 to analyze your commits and generate meaningful release notes
- Automatically calculates semantic version bumps
- Generates and maintains CHANGELOG.md
- Deploys to AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s, Docker (pretty much anywhere)
- Supports blue-green, canary, and rolling deployments

**The coolest part:** It actually understands your code changes. Instead of generic commit messages in your changelog, you get proper summaries of what actually changed and why it matters.

**Setup is literally 2 minutes:**
```yaml
- uses: Geppix140269/release-pilot@v1
  with:
    openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

It's been handling my own deployments for the past few months and saving me about 10 hours per month.

Would love feedback from the DevOps community! What features would make this more useful for your workflows?

P.S. - Happy to give free licenses to anyone willing to provide detailed feedback. Just DM me!

## r/github

**Title:** [Show r/github] Free GitHub Action that uses AI to automate semantic versioning and changelog generation

**Post:**

Built this GitHub Action that's been saving me tons of time, thought the community might find it useful!

**Problem it solves:**
Every time you merge a PR, you need to:
1. Decide on version bump (major/minor/patch)
2. Update version files
3. Write changelog entries
4. Create GitHub release
5. Deploy to production

**ReleasePilot automates all of this:**
- AI analyzes your commits and PRs
- Automatically determines version bumps
- Generates human-readable changelogs
- Creates GitHub releases with proper notes
- Handles deployments to any cloud provider

**Example changelog it generates:**
```markdown
## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- New authentication system with OAuth2 support
- Dashboard analytics for user metrics

### Fixed
- Memory leak in background workers
- CSS issues on mobile devices

### Changed
- Upgraded to Node.js 20 for better performance
```

**Free for open source projects!** Commercial plans start at $19/month.

Would love to hear how you're currently handling releases and if this could help!

## r/programming

**Title:** Spent 6 months building an AI tool that automates the boring parts of software releases - what do you think?

**Post:**

Hey r/programming!

Like many of you, I was spending hours every week on repetitive release tasks - writing changelogs, bumping versions, creating release notes, managing deployments. It felt like such a waste of engineering time.

So I built ReleasePilot - a GitHub Action that uses AI to automate the entire release process.

**The technical approach:**
- Uses OpenAI's API to analyze code changes and generate summaries
- Parses conventional commits for semantic versioning
- Maintains a structured CHANGELOG.md file
- Integrates with GitHub's release API
- Handles multi-cloud deployments via provider SDKs

**What makes it different:**
- The AI actually understands context. It doesn't just list commits - it explains what changed and why it matters
- Zero config for basic use, deeply customizable for complex workflows
- Works with your existing CI/CD - it's just another GitHub Action
- Supports every major cloud provider and deployment strategy

**Some numbers after using it myself:**
- 10+ hours saved per month
- 0 manual version bumps in 6 months
- 95% reduction in deployment errors
- Actually useful changelog entries

I'm a solo developer and would really appreciate feedback from the community. What am I missing? What would make this more useful for your workflows?

Thanks for checking it out! Happy to answer any technical questions.

## r/startups (Bonus)

**Title:** Just launched my first SaaS - automates software releases with AI. Any advice for a first-time founder?

**Post:**

Hey r/startups!

Just launched ReleasePilot - my first SaaS product. It's a GitHub Action that uses AI to automate releases, versioning, and deployments.

**The journey so far:**
- 6 months building while working full-time
- Launched on GitHub Marketplace yesterday
- Already have 2 paying customers (friends, but still counts right? üòÖ)
- Pricing: $19/$49/$199 per month

**What I'm struggling with:**
1. How to reach developers who need this but don't know it exists?
2. Is my pricing too high/low for the value provided?
3. Should I focus on individual developers or teams/enterprises?
4. How to compete with free alternatives (that do 10% of what mine does)?

**What's working:**
- The product actually saves me 10+ hours/month
- Early users love the AI-generated release notes
- 2-minute setup is a huge selling point

Would love advice from founders who've been through this journey. How did you get your first 100 customers? What marketing channels worked for developer tools?

Thanks in advance!
