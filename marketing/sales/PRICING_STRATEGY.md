### Objection Handling

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I understand. Consider that ReleasePilot saves the average team 10 hours per month. At $100/hour, that's $1,000 in savings for just $49. Plus, I can offer you 20% off to start."

**"We can build this ourselves"**
> "Absolutely you could! But consider: it would take 2-3 weeks to build and ongoing maintenance. ReleasePilot is ready today for less than the cost of 1 hour of developer time per month."

**"We need to think about it"**
> "Of course! While you're evaluating, would you like to try it free on a public repo? Or I can extend your trial to 30 days to give you more time to test with your team."
