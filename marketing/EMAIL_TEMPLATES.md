## üéØ Cold Outreach Templates

### Template 1: The Time-Saver
**Subject:** Quick question about your deployment process

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] has an active GitHub presence with frequent deployments.

Quick question - how much time does your team spend on release notes, versioning, and deployments each week?

Most teams waste 10+ hours monthly on these tasks. We've built ReleasePilot to automate the entire process using AI, so developers can focus on shipping features instead of paperwork.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call to see if this could help [Company] ship faster?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We integrate with your existing GitHub workflow in under 2 minutes.

### Template 2: The Competitor Angle
**Subject:** How [Competitor] ships 3x faster than most teams

Hi [First Name],

[Competitor] recently started shipping features 3x faster after automating their release process.

They're using AI to:
- Generate PR documentation automatically
- Manage semantic versioning
- Deploy to multiple environments
- Create release notes without manual work

Curious if [Company] might benefit from similar automation?

Takes 2 minutes to set up, and we offer a 14-day free trial.

Worth a quick chat?

### Template 3: The Problem/Solution
**Subject:** Tired of writing release notes?

Hi [First Name],

If your developers are like most, they hate writing documentation and managing deployments.

ReleasePilot solves this by:
‚úÖ AI writes PR summaries and release notes
‚úÖ Automatic version management (semver)
‚úÖ One-click deploy to AWS/Azure/GCP
‚úÖ Instant rollback if issues occur

One of our customers said: "It's like having a DevOps engineer who never sleeps and costs less than Netflix."

Interested in a quick demo? I can show you the 2-minute setup.

Hi [First Name],

Even if ReleasePilot isn't a fit right now, thought you might appreciate this:

### Follow-Up 3: The Break-Up
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about helping [Company] automate deployments and save 10+ hours monthly.

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming either:
1. This isn't a priority right now
2. You're happy with your current process
3. My emails are going to spam

If you'd like me to check back in a few months when you might have more bandwidth, just let me know. Otherwise, I'll close your file.

All the best,
[Your Name]
