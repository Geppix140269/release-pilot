## 🎤 Maker Comment:

"After spending countless hours on manual releases, I built ReleasePilot to automate everything. It's been handling my own deployments for months, saving me 10+ hours weekly. 

The AI understands your code changes and writes better release notes than most developers (including me 😅).

Happy to answer any questions and would love your feedback!"

Hi [Name],

I built ReleasePilot - an AI-powered GitHub Action that automates the entire release process (versioning, changelogs, multi-cloud deployments).

It's been saving me 10+ hours/month and I think the PH community would love it.

Would you be interested in hunting it next Tuesday? Happy to give you lifetime access + mention you as a contributor.
