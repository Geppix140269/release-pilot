**Post:**

🚀 Excited to announce the launch of ReleasePilot!

After spending countless hours on manual releases, version bumping, and changelog writing, I decided there had to be a better way.

ReleasePilot is an AI-powered GitHub Action that completely automates your release process:

✅ AI generates PR summaries and release notes  
✅ Automatic semantic versioning  
✅ Multi-cloud deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s)  
✅ Blue-green, canary, and rolling strategies  
✅ 2-minute setup  

The AI actually understands your code changes and writes release notes that make sense - not just a list of commits.

**The impact so far:**
• Saving 10+ hours per month on DevOps tasks
• 95% fewer deployment errors
• Zero manual version bumping

🎁 **Special launch offer:** 30% off forever with code EARLY30

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback from the DevOps community!

## 🟠 Hacker News - Show HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: I built a GitHub Action that uses AI to automate software releases

**Post URL:** https://releasepilot.net

**Comment (post immediately after submission):**

Hi HN!

I built ReleasePilot after getting tired of spending hours every week on release management. It's a GitHub Action that uses AI (GPT-4) to automate the entire release process.

**Technical details:**

The action hooks into your GitHub workflow and:
1. Analyzes commits and PR descriptions using OpenAI's API
2. Determines semantic version bumps based on conventional commits
3. Generates human-readable changelog entries (not just commit lists)
4. Creates GitHub releases with comprehensive notes
5. Handles deployments to AWS, Azure, GCP, K8s, Docker, etc.
6. Supports advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)

**What makes it different:**

- The AI understands context. It doesn't just list changes - it explains what changed and why it matters to users
- Zero configuration for basic use - just add your OpenAI API key
- Works with your existing CI/CD pipeline
- Actually saves time (10+ hours/month for me)

**Architecture:**

- Written in TypeScript
- Runs as a GitHub Action (no external servers)
- Uses OpenAI API for content generation (~$0.002 per release)
- Integrates with GitHub API for releases
- Provider SDKs for cloud deployments

**Pricing:**

- Free for open source
- $19-199/month for commercial use
- You provide your own OpenAI API key

I'm a solo developer and would love feedback from the HN community. What features would make this more useful? What concerns would you have about using AI in your release process?

Happy to answer any technical questions!

An AI-powered GitHub Action that completely automates your release process.

No more manual version bumping, changelog writing, or deployment scripts.

A thread on how it saves me 10+ hours/month 🧵👇

The problem:
Every release requires:
- Deciding version bumps
- Writing changelogs  
- Creating release notes
- Running deployments
- Notifying the team

This takes HOURS every week.

**Tweet 3:**
ReleasePilot automates everything:

✅ AI analyzes your code changes
✅ Auto-generates semantic versions
✅ Writes human-readable changelogs
✅ Deploys to any cloud provider
✅ Notifies via Slack/Teams

Setup time: 2 minutes

**Tweet 4:**
The AI is the game-changer.

Instead of:
"fix: updated user service"

You get:
"Fixed authentication timeout issue affecting mobile users during peak hours"

It actually understands what changed and why it matters.

**Tweet 5:**
Live example from my changelog:
